## Motivation

Over the past five years, bitCny pegged  chinese RMB has become our strategic . In order to achieve our goal, we have to give up DEX and carry out a series of reforms: target mortgage rate, Black Swan protection, MSSR from 1.1 to 1.01, lock feeding price and so on. For bitCny, we have to do wrong things, such as black swan protection and lock feed price, temporarily abandon peg RMB, We hope that market prices will rise and peg  chinese RMB again.


We're like Don Quixote, challenging windmills, attacking them again and again. In the meantime, we have paid a painful price, and some one have paid hundreds of millions of bts. However, there are fewer and fewer active users of bts. At present, there are only 5,000 active users.


The market is always right. It's time to change. At present, the world of block chains is still very few people involved. It is too early to apply bitCny business scenarios. It may be possible  five years later, but not now. BitCny should not be the strategic  of bts, but become a financial derivative with stable returns. Bts's strategic  returns to the exchanges and attracting investors becomes the only important thing


## Worker Intent


Strategic positioningï¼šdex.

[1]Is DEX a pseudo-requirement?
BM decided to develop BTS after the failure of Mt. GOX in 2013. Today, it seems that the result is far more than expected, and it has a good performance in efficiency, security and user experience.However, from the market point of view, DEX seems to be being abandoned, many digital currency fans shouting the slogan of decentralization, in the case of knowing that CEX has no regulatory dark box operation, they will not hesitate to invest in its embrace, and disdain DEX. Not only outside the circle, the BTS community also almost unanimously believes that DEX has no ability to compete with CEX.


So what are the advantages of DEX over CEX?
1. User usability.
In the past two years, a variety of BTS mobile apps have emerged, such as Magic Wallet, GDEX, bts++. I have tried them very well, and they should not lag behind CEX. PC client is a pity. In fact, it would be better to have a WEB interface on PC.
2. Financial security.
Capital security is a key concern of both platforms and users. DEX has great advantages over CEX in this respect, which is reflected in the following aspects:
- 1. User authentication. CEX users are tricked by various styles. The platform can directly operate user accounts, the platform may reveal user secret keys, hackers crack user accounts. The key is that users can not tell where the problem is. Finally, the problem of hackers, their own problems, anyway, the platform is not responsible. DEX user authentication only relies on the private key. This information is the user's own responsibility, and there is no risk of trust.
- 2. web 
Server security. CEX has web servers, which may be attacked by hackers. If you take the web server privileges, you can take the user privileges. DEX's web server only provides Web pages, public APIs and other services, not much sensitive information, if it is through app, even the web server is not required.
- 3. It's safe to withdraw money. CEX recharge and withdrawal service relies on its own database, through database attacks, it may attack the recharge and withdrawal service of wallet, threatening the security of digital money wallet. DEX's recharge and withdrawal service relies on the transfer data on the block chain. It can't be attacked and the outside world can't know where the server that processes the recharge and withdrawal service is.
3. Platform stability.
CEX cannot resist DOS attacks, which is the weakness of centralized services. DEX can do a good job of guarding against DOS attacks, such as mobile apps may only rely on public API nodes, which can be built by themselves.
4. Certificate of funds
CEX capital certification is complex, requiring hash and publicity of server user data, as well as publicity of all wallet addresses. DEX is very simple, just need to publish the wallet address, because user balances are public data on the block chain.
5. The cost of platform maintenance.
The maintenance cost of DEX platform is infinitely lower than that of CEX. Sensitive data on CEX server includes user identity information, transaction database, wallet and so on, while DEX server is basically open information.
6. Other
DEX users can enjoy more functions, including transfer,  asset creation, more flexible API interface and so on.

In summary, the future trend is DEX. In the initial stage, CEX will rely on dark box operation to make huge profits, while in the mature stage, 90% of CEX will fail and DEX will live better and better.
Finally, add that don't confine to bitCNY anymore. DEX has too many advantages, and bitCNY will become better and better after it develops.

After the strategy returns to the exchange, it will focus on attracting investors.

We divide investors into four categories:
1. Investors with low risk preference.
For this kind of people, in pursuit of low-risk earnings, they will not mortgage BTS to lend out CNY to pursue high earnings, but they will have higher interest rates than the bank deposits in the physical world. Because there is a gap between the world of blockchain and the physical world, to realize the transfer of bank deposits in the physical world to BTS, I think it needs to be much higher than the income of bank deposits. This kind of people, a large number, once can attract them to enter will be a huge number.
2. Investors with moderate risk preference.
This kind of people tend to be quick thinking or mastering technology, but they don't have much money. It is often dominated by band, robot and arbitrage. These people are the main people who are active in trading, they care about volatility. The large number of such people is the main investor we strive for.
3. Investors with high risk preference.
This kind of people mortgage BTS to lend bitcny, then buy BTS, and pursue high income. At present, the effective account in the system is 27539, and the bitcny mortgage account is 2026, accounting for 7.36%. The rough estimate of pasting line is less than 2%. The current feed price lock-in is to protect them.
4. Institutional investors.
This kind of people often have a lot of money . They often use short selling attacks to collect BTS and find ways to increase the price to sell BTS. Are they our customers? From the perspective of the exchange, they are our customers.

- For people with low risk preference, we have the most suitable financial product: bitcny. They only need to earn the fluctuation of bitcny, and make 5 orders a year to have a considerable income. When a large number of bank deposits pour in, due to the competition of funds, we will get an approximate bitcny anchoring chinese yuan(rmb). The precise anchoring can not rely on the planned economy, not on adjusting parameters, but on the market.

- For those with moderate risk preference, it is our main target. These people are often opinion leaders of a small group, who bring a group of people into bithares. And they care about volatility. BTS naturally fluctuates, which is attractive to them. With the increase of such users, the competition will intensify, and finally the fluctuation will gradually disappear or be very small. By then, there will be many active users in BTS. This kind of customers may also do large band, which may not be operated several times a year.

- For investors with high risk preference, when they make the right bet, they will get high returns. When they make the wrong bet, the original full blown out mechanism will become a stop loss mechanism. The current mechanism of breaking positions is not enough to attract these adventurers.

- For institutional investors, the community has always had a prejudice that they are short sellers, but in fact they are not short sellers, only making money, and short and pull are one person. They use short selling attacks to collect BTS, find ways to make the price rise, sell BTS, and make profits. As for an exchange, it is necessary to face the reality, accept the baptism of capital, do a good job in the work of the exchange, and give the rest to the market.

In the past, it was exactly the scene we expected, a variety of investors were active in the platform provided by BTS. The high-risk preferred investment mortgage, at that time, was actually a stop loss mechanism, and those adventurers would buy the BTS with a short position in the low position. Human arbitrage and robot market making with moderate risk preference will quickly eliminate the interest margin in the market. People with low risk preference do bitcny merchants and bitcny arbitrage to obtain near risk-free profits and eliminate the premium or discount of bitcny.
You will say that it is a bull market. We don't deny that the bull market has played a great role, but the reform of the target mortgage rate has led to the loss of part of the mortgage investors, and bsip42 has lost a lot of loyal fans, while the black swan protection and lock-in  the feed price have dried up the liquidity. The current situation is that there are few investors except those with high risk preference.
This is a strategic positioning error, and the exclusion of other investors.

So our suggestion is: recovery mechanism. At least before the split on July 19, 2017, the current black swan protection and feed price locking are all expedient measures and should not exist as a long-term mechanism.
In order to stabilize the currency, we do not hesitate to use the means of "deception" to reduce the reputation of BTS. At the right time, give up the protection of black swan and lock in the feeding price, restore the reputation of BTS, and don't let pegging RMB become the last straw to overwhelm the camel. DEX can still make a big deal, there is no need to go all the way to the dark.
Because once the strategy is positioned as an exchange, it will be excluded from a series of previous reforms
1. The target mortgage rate, black swan protection, MSSR reduction from 1.1 to 1.01, lock-in feed price and other reforms will become obstacles and have to be abolished. Because the target mortgage rate is not conducive to attracting people with high risk preference, and black swan protection and lock-in feed price are unfair to other users. Since the black swan protection is to be abolished, MSSR cannot be reduced from 1.1 to 1.01, because it will often be black swan. So the simplest way is to recover mcr1.75 and mssr1.1.
2. After the recovery mechanism, those four types of customers, as long as there is profit space, will automatically return after a certain period of time, which does not need the community to operate. Of course, if there is a proper marketing promotion, it is better.


### Legal


### Marketing

1. Promote bitcny, a low-risk financial product, to users with low risk preference.
Bitcny is a huge temptation for low-risk investors. It can even be regarded as risk-free arbitrage. When bitcny's price is low, it can be recharged into bithares, and when bitcny's price is high, it can be withdrawn from bithares. You can get a good return. It is more suitable for offline promotion.
2. Promote DEX to people with moderate risk preference and attract them to the internal market.
The world of blockchain is still very small, and its promotion is not so complicated. The exposure rate of mainstream media platforms, well-known microblogs and self-Media reach consensus. When the value of BTS reaches a certain consensus, we will be able to open up more space in the offline market and gain more customer resources.
3. Promote mortgage BTS to people with high risk appetite and tell them about the risks and benefits.
Due to the impact of other currencies, most of the high-risk preference groups have transferred to the contract trading of CEX, and even mentioned BTS to them. Their first reaction is rejection. We need to reset the image of BTS. The continuous output of BTS is currently reliable, and we have a great chance of speculation and profit. Find those who have been disappointed in BTS and attract those who do not know BTS.





## Summary

The current status of bitshares community is that we give up other investors in order to protect investors with high risk preference. For 2% of users, we give up 98% of users, and BTS gradually declines. After a painful price, it's time to change. As an exchange, we can't be both referees and athletes. We should provide a stage. Investors should be the protagonists on the stage, and the spotlight should be the protagonists. First of all, we can make the exchange active. With a considerable fee income, we can continue to buy back and destroy. We can gradually increase the market value of BTS. When the market value of BTS reaches a certain scale, bitcny will come into being.
Bithares is not a decentralized blockchain project now, since witnesses have been forced to do something. We must ensure the independence of witnesses and restore the reputation of bithares, otherwise we will lose bithares.

Community members please consider this proposal.
